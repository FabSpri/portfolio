						<h2>Taking a gamble on broken Smartphones.</h2>
						
						<h6>I´m usually not too big on smartphones, at least when it comes to reintroducing them to second hand markets. In this day and age they´re designed and deliberately engineered as throwaway items, a catastrophy in terms of consumer rights and environmental damage. While they are still easily repairable from a technical point of view, the disassembly is often made as finnicky and irreversible as possible. Most modern units make heavy use of glue to hold the case and parts in place. Without a lot of care and patience it´s easy to cause permanent damage in the process. This makes smartphone repairs rather time consuming and inefficient when reckoned up against after market prices.
							This looks a bit different when factoring in repairs as a service, either for reasons of data recovery or to maintain mid to high end units. Or for personal use, of course.    
							<br><br>
							The later was the incentive for this little project. My 6 year old device had sustained significant damage over the years, including a cracked screen, a faulty extension card slot, and a blown battery. What ultimately put the nail in the coffin was a damaged USB charging port. I performed a quick provisional fix to backup the data via Bluetooth (<i>Fig. 1</i>), but it was clear at this point that there was little incentive to fix all the issues to a satisfying degree with reasonable investments of time and money. A pitty, since the main components were good to go, i was still quite satisfied with the performance and had rooted the phone years ago while installing LineageOS. So keeping software up to date was not an issue either. It had a good run, but it was time for a replacement.
							<br><br>
							After searching for a few days i found an intersting offer. A bundle of five partly damaged smartphones for 70 Euros (<i>Fig. 2</i>). Three were mid-range phones, two released in the last two to three years, one in the last five. The other two were older models and had cracked screens but were otherwise fully functional. Perfect candidates for becoming part donors or outdoor phones, especially since one of them was very light and compact. Of the three more interesting phones one was fully functional but had a cracked screen (Honor P8). One was functional and in almost mint condition, but the microphone was not working (Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro). And the last one (Samsung Galaxy A50) was not functional at all but was also in mint visual condition. I took a bit of a gamble on the Samsung Galaxy A50, but as it turned out its problems were rather simple to fix.

							<u>Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro</u><br><br>
							After an intital inspection the phone turned out to be in mint condition. As advertised the microphone wasn´t picking up any sound, but was producing constant noise with a rather clear defined amplitude. In this case the crystal based digital microphone and corresponging circuitry was located on the PCB housing the USB-C port and the headphone jack. During some quick measurements i noticed that the data_out line was reading a constant voltage, probably due to an internal failure of the microphone package. I had previously salvaged some replacement microphones, but none had the right pinout configuration or package size (<i>Fig. 3</i>). While it would have been possible to bridge the corresponding solder pads with wires, there was little room to work with once the speaker element was put back into the case. While checking the prices for a replacement microphone i noticed that the entire PCB was available for just under 10 Euros (depending on configuration and additonal filter caps). A single SMD microphone was hard to come by at significantly cheaper prices and sensible amounts of logistical effort. So i decided to replace the whole PCB assembly, going with a higher quality version for around 10 Euros. Switching the PCB was an easy task and fixed the microphone issue. Otherwise the phone was in excellent condition. This fix alone more than made up for the initial investment.

							<u>Samsung Galaxy A50</u><br><br>
							This phone appeared to be completely dead. I quickly noticed however that the back cover was not seated properly. There were no signs that it had been removed prior to my purchase. After disassembling the phone it turned out that the battery had failed and was buldging up. Luckily it suffered no further mechanical damage or leakage. I carefully removed the impending fire hazard to mitigate the risks of it blowing up completely<i>(Fig. 6:)</i>. Now the phone gave a quick sign of life while attaching a charging cable despite refusing to complete the boot cycle. Yet this had me in good hopes that a simple battery replacement would fix the issue. I found the corresponding model for just under 9 Euros, making it a sensible investment, allthough i still couldn´t be sure that there weren´t any further issues.
							<br><br>
							As it turned out there weren´t any however, at least in terms of technical functionality. After replacing the battery the phone booted up just fine. I quickly ran into the problem that is Samsungs enforced Google FRP protection, where even when you factory reset the phone it will still asks you to verify the previously registered Google account. This was a problem indeed, since this was the only phone i acquired from the buyer, that was not factory reset before the purchase. The corresponding unlock pattern was long lost however and for obvious reasons handing over the login credentials for the corresponding account wasn´t an option. After hours of researching the topic i finally stumbled across a bypass. I won´t go into detials here since options like these are firmly seated within grey areas of data security at best, but it enabled me to define my own verification method to continue with the factory reset. This method involved deliberately crashing the interface of the installation routine by input flooding and hotswaping SIM cards to gain access to UI elements usually not accessible during the setup process.
							Since the data wipe was already performed previously by utilizing the boot menu and account credentials and details could not be accessed either way, i decided that this was a morally acceptable procedure to prevent the phone from becoming unusable. After setting up the phone with my personal data, the phone turned out to work just fine. <i>(Fig. 7)</i>

							Apart from the broken glass cover of the LCD screen, this phone was fully functional. Removing the screen was a straightforward albeit messy task. Carefully applying heat with the rework station on lowest settings liquified the glue and enabled me to extract the glass with the help of some razor blades <i>(Fig. 8)</i>. The LCD display stayed intact during this procedure, but when looking at prices for replacement parts i quickly figured out that salvaging the LCD screen made little sense. Complete packages, containing the glass cover, the LCD screen and backlight assembly come for around 20 Euros. <i>(Fig. 9)</i> I ordered a new one, but delivery will take some time.

							<u>LG G3 and HTC Desire C</u><br><br>
							Both of these phones were working perfectely fine but had cracked screens. Due to their age i decided against performing extensive repair attempts. Both will become part donors for SMD components in case the need arises or serve as replacement phones in case of a technical emergency.   
							<br><br>
							<u>Conclusion</u><br><br>
							So all in all, what did we get for 70 bucks? We got three partly damaged and/or non-functional smartphones, two of which are mid-class models released within the last two years. One, the Honor 8, being a tad older but still adequate in terms of security updates and performance. The combined second hand market value of these three phones alone currently exceeds 300 Euros, regarding their good to mint condition. Roughly 40 Euros were spend on replacement parts, amounting to total costs of around 110 Euros. On top of that i got two fully functional old-timers, which can be used for future projects or in case of an emergency. All in all i´d argue that this was a rather neat deal which involved a manageable amount of neccessary fault finding and repairs, saving fiver phones from wandering straight into a garbage bin. Not too shabby.
